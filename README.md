## Overview

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains a collection of LeetCode questions and their solutions in various programming languages. It is designed to help you prepare for coding interviews and improve your problem-solving skills.

## Topics Covered

The repository covers a wide range of topics commonly encountered in coding interviews, including:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Bit Manipulation
- and more!

## How to Use

To benefit from this repository:

1. Browse the `src` directory to find the LeetCode problem you want to solve.
2. Each problem is organized in its own folder, named after the problem's title or number.
3. Within each problem's folder, you will find the solution in various programming languages (e.g., Java, Python, C++).
4. Study the solutions, analyze the code, and try to solve the problems on your own first.
5. Feel free to contribute your own solutions or improvements to existing ones.
